# Instrumente-Rate-Spiel

![KuKuWi](static/images/logo_name.png)

This project was developed for the "Kunst, Kultur und Wissenschaft" (KuKuWi) initiative by Klangger√ºst e.V. Its goal is to make music an engaging experience and promote understanding of sounds, instruments, and musical patterns.

## Game Modes

The project currently offers the following game modes:

1. **Identify Instruments:**
   - Players listen to short audio samples and must identify the correct instrument.
2. **Match MIDI Patterns:**
   - A sound sample is played, and the player matches it to the corresponding MIDI pattern.
3. **Genre Music Memory:**
   - A memory game featuring different music genres.

The current version is available at https://davidblaa.github.io/kukuwi/.

The project is built using SvelteKit and can also be run locally.

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Adding More Audio Samples

### Identify Instruments

1. Place audio file(s) in [./static/audios/]().
2. Extend the JSON in [./scr/data/instruments.ts](src/lib/data/instruments.ts) as follows:

```javascript
{
    name: 'name of the instrument',
    category: 'category of the instrument',
    image: 'icon of the instrument',
    audios: [
        Audio_sample_1.mp3,
        Audio_sample_2.wav,
        ...
    ]
},
```

### Match Patterns

1. Place audio file(s) in [./static/audios/pattern-sounds/](#).
2. Place MIDI file(s) in [./static/audios/midis/](#).
3. Extend the JSON in [./scr/data/instruments.ts](src/lib/data/instruments.ts) as follows:

```javascript
{
    midi_src: 'midi_sample.mid',
    audio_src: 'audio_sample.wav',
    instrument_type: 'instrument category' from ["Drum", "Piano", "Bass"]
},
```

#### Notes on MIDI Files:

- More than 6 different tones are not recommended.
- Ideally, use four measures.
- Notes such as 3/4, 5/6, etc., may cause issues with MIDI parsing.

### Genre Memory

1. Place audio file(s) in [./static/audios/](#).
2. Extend the JSON in [./src/lib/data/memoryCards.ts](src/lib/data/memoryCards.ts) as follows:

```javascript
{
    genre: "genre name",
    audioPaths: ["audio_sample.mp3"]
},
```
